stereo-vision-cpp
=================
Stereo vision application using MRF minimization algorithm based on the paper "A Comparative Study of Energy Minimization Methods for Markov Random Fields with Smoothness-Based Priors" and sample C++ code by Szeliski, et. al.
The front end module is in mrfstereo with inputs of left and right image and an output of the gray scale nearness profile, brighter is closer.
Sample usage: ./mrfstereo tsukuba/tsukuba-im* tsukuba/tsukuba.png
